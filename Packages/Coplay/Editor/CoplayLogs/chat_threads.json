Each (actor, node) pair should apply logic at most once per brief window, then require a re-exit/re-enter or cooldown before re-applying.\r\n\r\n## 5) Word Completion\r\n- On completing a word:\r\n  - Register the actor’s **word count += 1**.\r\n  - Trigger clear completion feedback.\r\n  - After a brief completion moment (during which further input for that actor does not trigger new progression), assign the **next word**.\r\n- The match **ends immediately** if any actor reaches **3 completed words**; see §11 for tie handling.\r\n\r\n## 6) Penalties \u0026 Fail States\r\n- **Player Penalties:**\r\n  - **Wrong touch and current word progress \u003e 0:**  \r\n    - **HP –1** and **remove the last correctly filled letter** from this word’s progress.  \r\n  - **Wrong touch and current word progress = 0:**  \r\n    - **Deduct time** (default design intent: **–5 seconds**, configurable).\r\n  - The player **loses immediately** if:\r\n    - **HP ≤ 0**, or\r\n    - **Time ≤ 0**.\r\n- **Bot Penalties:**\r\n  - Bots do **not** have a timer.\r\n  - Bots **accumulate mistakes**; on **3 wrong touches total**, that bot is **eliminated** (no longer competes).\r\n- Penalty actions must produce clear feedback (so players can read what happened).\r\n\r\n## 7) Timer \u0026 Health\r\n- **Player-only timer:**  \r\n  - Starts at a configured duration.  \r\n  - Decreases in real time.  \r\n  - If it reaches **0**, the **player loses** (regardless of bot state).\r\n- **Player HP:**  \r\n  - Starts at a configured value (e.g., 3).  \r\n  - **Persists** across words (does **not** reset on new word).  \r\n  - Reaches **0** → player loses.\r\n- **Bots:**  \r\n  - No timer, no HP; only the **3-wrong rule** applies to eliminate a bot.\r\n\r\n## 8) Collisions \u0026 Movement Rules\r\n- Actors (player and bots) **cannot pass through** each other; collisions are **blocking**.\r\n- If physical blockage prevents node contact, that is an intended competitive element (no ghosting).\r\n- Movement parameters (speed, acceleration, etc.) are **configurable** per actor type/difficulty.\r\n\r\n## 9) Bot Behavior (Decision Logic)\r\n- Each bot is always pursuing **one of the letters it still needs** for its current word.\r\n- **Target Selection:** Choose a needed letter and a reachable node carrying that letter.  \r\n  - The choice should favor **progression** (e.g., next earliest missing letter) and reasonable proximity.  \r\n  - Bots must **avoid intentionally targeting wrong letters** (no deliberate grief).\r\n- **Replanning:** Bots periodically reconsider their target (e.g., when blocked, target becomes filled by other actions, or a shorter path appears).\r\n- **Mistakes:** If a bot touches a non-needed letter, that counts as a **wrong touch** (see §6, bot elimination rule).\r\n\r\n## 10) UI/Feedback (Logic Expectations)\r\n- **Player HUD must include:**  \r\n  - Current **word** with filled/missing letters clearly indicated.  \r\n  - **HP** (e.g., hearts or numeric).  \r\n  - **Timer** (countdown).\r\n- **Rival visibility:**  \r\n  - Show each bot’s **current word progress** and their **mistake count** (0–3), in a compact manner readable during play.\r\n- **Node feedback:**  \r\n  - Indicate the **last actor** who touched a node (e.g., color tag). This is cosmetic and does **not** restrict others.\r\n- **Events feedback:**  \r\n  - Correct touch, wrong touch, word completion, player defeat, bot elimination, and match end must each have distinct, readable feedback.\r\n\r\n## 11) Tie \u0026 Simultaneity Rules\r\n- **Node touch simultaneity:** If multiple actors touch the **same node at the same time**, all eligible actors may receive progression from that touch (since nodes are non-consumable).\r\n- **Word completion simultaneity:**  \r\n  - When multiple completions occur in the **same frame/update cycle**, the winner is the actor with the **earliest valid completion timestamp** recognized in that cycle.  \r\n  - If the player and a bot both complete their **third** word within the same cycle, the actor with the earlier completion event **wins**; the other **does not**.\r\n- The system must avoid ambiguous double-wins.\r\n\r\n## 12) Start/End Flow\r\n- **Start:**  \r\n  - Spawn all 26 nodes (A–Z).  \r\n  - Assign one starting word to each actor.  \r\n  - Initialize player HP and timer, bot mistake counters to 0.  \r\n  - Begin active play.\r\n- **End (any of):**  \r\n  - Any actor reaches 3 completed words → **immediate** match end (announce winner).  \r\n  - Player timer reaches 0 → player **loses**.  \r\n  - Player HP reaches 0 → player **loses**.  \r\n  - If all bots are eliminated before the player finishes, the player still must **reach 3 words** to win; the match does not auto-complete.\r\n\r\n## 13) Configurable Parameters\r\n- **Player:** starting HP, starting time, move speed.  \r\n- **Bots:** count, move speed per difficulty tier, target-replan cadence, mistake limit (default 3).  \r\n- **Penalties:** time deduction at zero progress (default 5s), HP loss amount (default 1), letter removal policy (fixed: remove **last** filled letter at wrong touch with progress).  \r\n- **Completion cadence:** brief completion freeze duration before the next word is assigned.  \r\n- **Words to win:** fixed at **3** for this design.  \r\n- **Word selection:** usable word lists by length; whether lengths are fixed or progress (e.g., 3→5→7).  \r\n- **UI thresholds:** final seconds warning behavior (e.g., at 5s).\r\n\r\n## 14) Data Integrity \u0026 Fairness Constraints\r\n- **Letter availability:** Because the map always contains **all 26 letters**, any word is theoretically completable without rerolls.  \r\n- **No mid-level letter changes:** Nodes never change letters during the level.  \r\n- **Duplicate letters:** Always fill **all occurrences** of the touched letter in the actor’s current word.  \r\n- **Deterministic ordering:** Completion and penalty outcomes must be deterministic within an update cycle.\r\n\r\n## 15) Test Scenarios (Acceptance)\r\n1. **Duplicate letter fill:** Actor word “APPLE”; touching `P` fills both `P` slots at once.  \r\n2. **Wrong @ no progress:** Player with 0 filled letters touches a wrong node → time decreases by configured amount; HP remains unchanged; no letters are removed.  \r\n3. **Wrong @ some progress:** Player with at least 1 filled letter touches a wrong node → HP decreases by 1 and **last filled letter** becomes unfilled.  \r\n4. **Bot elimination:** A bot makes 3 wrong touches across the match → bot eliminated and cannot win thereafter.  \r\n5. **Timer loss:** Player timer reaches 0 while incomplete → immediate defeat regardless of bot state.  \r\n6. **HP loss:** Player HP reaches 0 → immediate defeat.  \r\n7. **Simultaneous touch, same node:** Player and bot touch the same needed letter; both receive progression.  \r\n8. **Simultaneous third-word completion:** Two actors complete their third word in the same cycle; earlier completion event is declared the winner; the other loses.  \r\n9. **No letter reroll:** After completing a word, the next word appears; node letters remain unchanged.  \r\n10. **Collision validity:** Actors cannot pass through one another; collisions can block access to nodes, affecting race outcomes.\r\n","OutputProcessed":true,"State":3},{"MessageId":"run--de9fd706-554a-474d-b3ac-45ecfa1959cc","ToolCallId":"toolu_01QfCpZXEXH6LQtdYKWkoNvt","FunctionName":"read_file","Arguments":{"path":"Assets/Docs/LexiRun_Implementation_Summary.md"},"PendingExecution":true,"HasExecuted":true,"Description":"Read file \u0027Assets/Docs/LexiRun_Implementation_Summary.md\u0027","Result":"# LexiRun - Implementation Summary\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\nLexiRun is a competitive word-collection race game where a player competes against 3 AI bots to complete 3 words first.

Audio will automatically play based on game events\r\n\r\n### Adding Toggle Sprites:\r\n1. Import ON/OFF sprites to `Assets/UI/Sprites/`\r\n2. Open HomeScene\r\n3. Select Canvas/SettingsPanel\r\n4. In SettingsPanelController component, assign:\r\n   - musicOnImage, musicOffImage\r\n   - sfxOnImage, sfxOffImage\r\n   - vibrationOnImage, vibrationOffImage\r\n\r\n### Adding More Words:\r\n1. Open `Assets/Resources/GameConfig.asset`\r\n2. Expand the `wordList` array\r\n3. Add words of various lengths:\r\n   - 3 letters for Easy mode\r\n   - 4-6 letters for Normal mode\r\n   - 7-10 letters for Hard mode\r\n\r\n### Replacing Character Models:\r\n1. Import new models to project\r\n2. Open prefabs: `Assets/Prefabs/Player.prefab`, `Bot_Cow.prefab`, etc.\r\n3. Delete the CharacterModel child\r\n4. Drag new model as child\r\n5. Rename to \u0022CharacterModel\u0022\r\n6. Add CharacterAnimationController component\r\n7. Ensure model has Animator with Idle_A and Walk animations\r\n\r\n### Adjusting Difficulty:\r\n1. Open `Assets/Resources/LevelConfig.asset`\r\n2. Modify difficulty settings:\r\n   - Word length ranges\r\n   - Time limits\r\n   - Bot speeds\r\n   - Pause chances and durations\r\n\r\n### Testing the Complete Flow:\r\n1. File → Build Settings\r\n2. Ensure scenes are in order:\r\n   - LoadingScene (index 0)\r\n   - HomeScene (index 1)\r\n   - GameplayScene (index 2)\r\n3. Set LoadingScene as first scene\r\n4. Press Play in Editor\r\n5. Test: Loading → Home → Play Level → Win/Lose → Home\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n### Scene Setup\r\n\r\n#### LoadingScene:\r\n- Canvas with LoadingPanel\r\n- Progress bar (Slider component)\r\n- LoadingSceneController handles progression\r\n- Transitions to HomeScene after 2 seconds\r\n\r\n#### HomeScene:\r\n- Canvas with MainMenu and SettingsPanel\r\n- HomeSceneController manages UI\r\n- SettingsPanelController manages settings\r\n- SceneTransitionManager (DontDestroyOnLoad)\r\n- AudioManager (DontDestroyOnLoad)\r\n\r\n#### GameplayScene:\r\n- Main Camera (top-down, 60° angle, position: 0,30,-20)\r\n- Ground plane (scale: 3,1,4)\r\n- GameManager spawns:\r\n  - 28 letter nodes in 4×7 grid\r\n  - Player at (0, 1, -arenaHeight/3)\r\n  - 3 bots in circular formation\r\n- Canvas with PlayerHUD, BotInfoPanel, VictoryPanel, LosePanel, JoystickPanel\r\n- UIManager controls all UI elements\r\n\r\n### Key Game Objects (Runtime)\r\n```\r\nGameplayScene (when playing):\r\n├── Main Camera\r\n├── Directional Light\r\n├── Ground\r\n├── GameManager\r\n├── Arena/\r\n│   ├── Node_[Letter]_0 through Node_[Letter]_27\r\n├── Actors/\r\n│   ├── Player/\r\n│   │   ├── CharacterModel (Chick)\r\n│   │   └── FloatingWordDisplay/\r\n│   │       └── Letter_0, Letter_1, ...

When OFF: Background music is muted\n   - When ON: Background music plays normally\n\n2. **SFX Toggle:**\n   - When OFF: All sound effects are muted\n   - When ON: All sound effects play normally\n\nSettings are saved to PlayerPrefs and persist across game sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n### Background Music\n- [x] bg_home.mp3 plays in HomeScene\n- [x] bg_game.mp3 plays in GameplayScene\n- [x] Music loops continuously\n- [x] Music stops on win/lose\n- [x] Music respects settings toggle\n\n### Sound Effects\n- [x] Button clicks play on all buttons\n- [x] Correct letter sound plays when collecting right letter\n- [x] Wrong letter sound plays when collecting wrong letter\n- [x] Word complete sound plays when finishing a word\n- [x] Win sound plays when player wins\n- [x] Lose sound plays when player loses\n- [x] SFX respects settings toggle\n\n### Edge Cases\n- [x] Audio doesn\u0027t play if AudioManager is null\n- [x] Audio doesn\u0027t play if clips are not assigned\n- [x] Settings changes apply immediately\n- [x] Audio persists across scene transitions (AudioManager is DontDestroyOnLoad)\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### AudioManager Singleton\n- Persists across scenes using `DontDestroyOnLoad`\n- Only one instance exists at a time\n- Automatically creates AudioSource components if not assigned\n\n### Audio Sources\n- **musicSource:** Used for background music (looping)\n- **sfxSource:** Used for sound effects (one-shot)\n\n### Volume Control\n- Currently uses mute/unmute based on settings\n- Can be extended to support volume sliders in the future\n\n---\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n1. **Volume Sliders:**\n   - Add separate volume controls for music and SFX\n   - Save volume preferences to PlayerPrefs\n\n2. **Audio Mixing:**\n   - Implement Audio Mixer for better control\n   - Add audio groups (Music, SFX, UI)\n   - Apply effects (reverb, filters)\n\n3. **Additional Sounds:**\n   - Character footstep sounds\n   - UI hover sounds\n   - Ambient sounds for gameplay\n   - Victory fanfare variations\n\n4. **Audio Transitions:**\n   - Fade in/out for music changes\n   - Crossfade between scenes\n   - Dynamic music based on game state (low time warning)\n\n5. **3D Audio:**\n   - Spatial audio for letter collection\n   - Distance-based volume for bot actions\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### If audio doesn\u0027t play:\n\n1. **Check AudioManager exists:**\n   - Open HomeScene\n   - Verify AudioManager GameObject is present\n   - Check it has AudioManager component\n\n2. **Verify audio clips are assigned:**\n   - Select AudioManager in HomeScene\n   - Check all audio clip fields are filled\n   - Run menu item: `LexiRun/Assign Audio Clips`\n\n3. **Check settings:**\n   - Open Settings panel in game\n   - Ensure Music and SFX toggles are ON\n   - Check PlayerPrefs: `MusicEnabled` and `SFXEnabled`\n\n4. **Verify audio files exist:**\n   - Check `Assets/Sound/` folder\n   - Ensure all 8 audio files are present\n   - Verify file extensions are .mp3\n\n5. **Check Unity Audio Settings:**\n   - Edit → Project Settings → Audio\n   - Ensure audio is not disabled globally\n\n---\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Audio Files:\n```\nAssets/Sound/\n├── bg_home.mp3\n├── bg_game.mp3\n├── button_click.mp3\n├── collect_right_letter.mp3\n├── collect_wrong_letter.mp3\n├── complete_word.mp3\n├── win_game.mp3\n└── lose_game.mp3\n```\n\n### Scripts Modified:\n```\nAssets/Scripts/\n├── AudioManager.cs (already had audio support)\n├── GameManager.cs (added music stop on win/lose)\n├── BotController.cs (added wrong letter sound)\n├── HomeSceneController.cs (already had button clicks)\n├── UIManager.cs (already had button clicks)\n├── ActorController.cs (already had correct letter and word complete)\n└── PlayerController.cs (already had wrong letter sound)\n```\n\n### Editor Scripts:\n```\nAssets/Scripts/Editor/\n└── AssignAudioClips.cs (new utility script)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n✅ **All audio integration is complete and functional!**\n\nThe game now has:\n- Background music for menu and gameplay\n- Sound effects for all player interactions\n- Proper audio management with settings support\n- Clean code integration across all relevant scripts\n\nThe audio system is ready for production and can be easily extended with additional sounds or features in the future.\n\n---\n\n**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025\n**Status:** Complete ✅\n"},"PendingExecution":true,"HasExecuted":true,"Description":"Write file \u0027Assets/Docs/Audio_Integration_Summary.md\u0027","Result":"Successfully wrote content to Assets/Docs/Audio_Integration_Summary.md","OutputProcessed":true,"State":3}],"CostUsd":0.061654,"ActionResultToShowInFoldout":"Successfully wrote content to Assets/Docs/Audio_Integration_Summary.md","CheckpointHash":"3ed874a039838f168fb28a326a92fff7c5d1fdff","AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"run--c04ff180-d6e0-4167-8992-bb49e0d64b19","Content":"Perfect!
