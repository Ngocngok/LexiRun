Each (actor, node) pair should apply logic at most once per brief window, then require a re-exit/re-enter or cooldown before re-applying.\r\n\r\n## 5) Word Completion\r\n- On completing a word:\r\n  - Register the actor’s **word count += 1**.\r\n  - Trigger clear completion feedback.\r\n  - After a brief completion moment (during which further input for that actor does not trigger new progression), assign the **next word**.\r\n- The match **ends immediately** if any actor reaches **3 completed words**; see §11 for tie handling.\r\n\r\n## 6) Penalties \u0026 Fail States\r\n- **Player Penalties:**\r\n  - **Wrong touch and current word progress \u003e 0:**  \r\n    - **HP –1** and **remove the last correctly filled letter** from this word’s progress.  \r\n  - **Wrong touch and current word progress = 0:**  \r\n    - **Deduct time** (default design intent: **–5 seconds**, configurable).\r\n  - The player **loses immediately** if:\r\n    - **HP ≤ 0**, or\r\n    - **Time ≤ 0**.\r\n- **Bot Penalties:**\r\n  - Bots do **not** have a timer.\r\n  - Bots **accumulate mistakes**; on **3 wrong touches total**, that bot is **eliminated** (no longer competes).\r\n- Penalty actions must produce clear feedback (so players can read what happened).\r\n\r\n## 7) Timer \u0026 Health\r\n- **Player-only timer:**  \r\n  - Starts at a configured duration.  \r\n  - Decreases in real time.  \r\n  - If it reaches **0**, the **player loses** (regardless of bot state).\r\n- **Player HP:**  \r\n  - Starts at a configured value (e.g., 3).  \r\n  - **Persists** across words (does **not** reset on new word).  \r\n  - Reaches **0** → player loses.\r\n- **Bots:**  \r\n  - No timer, no HP; only the **3-wrong rule** applies to eliminate a bot.\r\n\r\n## 8) Collisions \u0026 Movement Rules\r\n- Actors (player and bots) **cannot pass through** each other; collisions are **blocking**.\r\n- If physical blockage prevents node contact, that is an intended competitive element (no ghosting).\r\n- Movement parameters (speed, acceleration, etc.) are **configurable** per actor type/difficulty.\r\n\r\n## 9) Bot Behavior (Decision Logic)\r\n- Each bot is always pursuing **one of the letters it still needs** for its current word.\r\n- **Target Selection:** Choose a needed letter and a reachable node carrying that letter.  \r\n  - The choice should favor **progression** (e.g., next earliest missing letter) and reasonable proximity.  \r\n  - Bots must **avoid intentionally targeting wrong letters** (no deliberate grief).\r\n- **Replanning:** Bots periodically reconsider their target (e.g., when blocked, target becomes filled by other actions, or a shorter path appears).\r\n- **Mistakes:** If a bot touches a non-needed letter, that counts as a **wrong touch** (see §6, bot elimination rule).\r\n\r\n## 10) UI/Feedback (Logic Expectations)\r\n- **Player HUD must include:**  \r\n  - Current **word** with filled/missing letters clearly indicated.  \r\n  - **HP** (e.g., hearts or numeric).  \r\n  - **Timer** (countdown).\r\n- **Rival visibility:**  \r\n  - Show each bot’s **current word progress** and their **mistake count** (0–3), in a compact manner readable during play.\r\n- **Node feedback:**  \r\n  - Indicate the **last actor** who touched a node (e.g., color tag). This is cosmetic and does **not** restrict others.\r\n- **Events feedback:**  \r\n  - Correct touch, wrong touch, word completion, player defeat, bot elimination, and match end must each have distinct, readable feedback.\r\n\r\n## 11) Tie \u0026 Simultaneity Rules\r\n- **Node touch simultaneity:** If multiple actors touch the **same node at the same time**, all eligible actors may receive progression from that touch (since nodes are non-consumable).\r\n- **Word completion simultaneity:**  \r\n  - When multiple completions occur in the **same frame/update cycle**, the winner is the actor with the **earliest valid completion timestamp** recognized in that cycle.  \r\n  - If the player and a bot both complete their **third** word within the same cycle, the actor with the earlier completion event **wins**; the other **does not**.\r\n- The system must avoid ambiguous double-wins.\r\n\r\n## 12) Start/End Flow\r\n- **Start:**  \r\n  - Spawn all 26 nodes (A–Z).  \r\n  - Assign one starting word to each actor.  \r\n  - Initialize player HP and timer, bot mistake counters to 0.  \r\n  - Begin active play.\r\n- **End (any of):**  \r\n  - Any actor reaches 3 completed words → **immediate** match end (announce winner).  \r\n  - Player timer reaches 0 → player **loses**.  \r\n  - Player HP reaches 0 → player **loses**.  \r\n  - If all bots are eliminated before the player finishes, the player still must **reach 3 words** to win; the match does not auto-complete.\r\n\r\n## 13) Configurable Parameters\r\n- **Player:** starting HP, starting time, move speed.  \r\n- **Bots:** count, move speed per difficulty tier, target-replan cadence, mistake limit (default 3).  \r\n- **Penalties:** time deduction at zero progress (default 5s), HP loss amount (default 1), letter removal policy (fixed: remove **last** filled letter at wrong touch with progress).  \r\n- **Completion cadence:** brief completion freeze duration before the next word is assigned.  \r\n- **Words to win:** fixed at **3** for this design.  \r\n- **Word selection:** usable word lists by length; whether lengths are fixed or progress (e.g., 3→5→7).  \r\n- **UI thresholds:** final seconds warning behavior (e.g., at 5s).\r\n\r\n## 14) Data Integrity \u0026 Fairness Constraints\r\n- **Letter availability:** Because the map always contains **all 26 letters**, any word is theoretically completable without rerolls.  \r\n- **No mid-level letter changes:** Nodes never change letters during the level.  \r\n- **Duplicate letters:** Always fill **all occurrences** of the touched letter in the actor’s current word.  \r\n- **Deterministic ordering:** Completion and penalty outcomes must be deterministic within an update cycle.\r\n\r\n## 15) Test Scenarios (Acceptance)\r\n1. **Duplicate letter fill:** Actor word “APPLE”; touching `P` fills both `P` slots at once.  \r\n2. **Wrong @ no progress:** Player with 0 filled letters touches a wrong node → time decreases by configured amount; HP remains unchanged; no letters are removed.  \r\n3. **Wrong @ some progress:** Player with at least 1 filled letter touches a wrong node → HP decreases by 1 and **last filled letter** becomes unfilled.  \r\n4. **Bot elimination:** A bot makes 3 wrong touches across the match → bot eliminated and cannot win thereafter.  \r\n5. **Timer loss:** Player timer reaches 0 while incomplete → immediate defeat regardless of bot state.  \r\n6. **HP loss:** Player HP reaches 0 → immediate defeat.  \r\n7. **Simultaneous touch, same node:** Player and bot touch the same needed letter; both receive progression.  \r\n8. **Simultaneous third-word completion:** Two actors complete their third word in the same cycle; earlier completion event is declared the winner; the other loses.  \r\n9. **No letter reroll:** After completing a word, the next word appears; node letters remain unchanged.  \r\n10. **Collision validity:** Actors cannot pass through one another; collisions can block access to nodes, affecting race outcomes.\r\n","OutputProcessed":true,"State":3}],"CostUsd":0.112031,"ActionResultToShowInFoldout":"# LexiRun — Feature \u0026 Logic Requirements\r\n\r\n## 1) Core Objective\r\n- A **single level** competitive word-collection race between **one player** and **N bots**.\r\n- Each actor must **complete 3 words**.  \r\n- **First** actor to complete 3 words **wins**.\r\n- The **player** can also **lose** if:\r\n  - Their **time reaches 0**, or\r\n  - Their **HP reaches 0**, or\r\n  - **Any bot** completes 3 words first.\r\n\r\n## 2) Arena \u0026 Nodes\r\n- The level contains exactly **26 letter nodes**, one for each **A–Z**.\r\n- Each node is permanently assigned a **single letter** for the entire level (no rerolling letters at any time).\r\n- A node can be “touched” by any actor any number of times;

I\u0027ve successfully implemented the LexiRun game according to all the requirements. Here\u0027s a comprehensive summary:\n\n## ✅ Implementation Complete!\n\n### What\u0027s Been Implemented:\n\n**Core Game Systems:**\n- ✅ **Word Management System** - Tracks word progress, fills duplicate letters simultaneously, removes last filled letter on penalty\n- ✅ **26 Letter Nodes** - Randomly positioned in a square arena, non-consumable, shows last actor who touched it via color\n- ✅ **Player Controller** - HP system (starts at 3), timer (60 seconds), movement via virtual joystick\n- ✅ **3 Bot Controllers** - AI that targets needed letters, eliminates after 3 mistakes\n- ✅ **Game Manager** - Handles match flow, word assignment, win/lose conditions\n\n**Game Mechanics (All Requirements Met):**\n- ✅ First to complete 3 words wins\n- ✅ Duplicate letter filling (touching \u0027P\u0027 fills both P\u0027s in \u0022APPLE\u0022)\n- ✅ Touch cooldown system to prevent spam\n- ✅ Player penalties:\n  - Wrong touch with progress \u003e 0: HP -1 and remove last filled letter\n  - Wrong touch with progress = 0: Time -5 seconds\n- ✅ Bot penalties: 3 mistakes = elimination\n- ✅ Player lose conditions: HP ≤ 0, Time ≤ 0, or bot wins first\n- ✅ Collision blocking between actors\n\n**Visual \u0026 UI:**\n- ✅ Top-down camera at 60° angle with perspective\n- ✅ Player HUD showing current word, HP, and timer\n- ✅ Bot info panels showing each bot\u0027s word progress, mistakes, and completed words\n- ✅ Virtual joystick for player movement (bottom-left)\n- ✅ Game Over screen with restart button\n- ✅ Color-coded actors and node feedback\n\n**Prefabs Created (Ready for Model Replacement):**\n- ✅ `LetterNode.prefab` - Cylinder primitive with letter text\n- ✅ `Player.prefab` - Capsule primitive (green)\n- ✅ `Bot.prefab` - Capsule primitive (colored per bot)\n- ✅ `BotInfoUI.prefab` - UI panel for bot information\n\n**Configuration:**\n- ✅ `GameConfig.asset` in Resources folder - All gameplay parameters are configurable\n- ✅ Built-in word list (26 words) - You can easily add more words later\n\n### How to Play:\n1. **Press Play** in the Unity Editor\n2. The game starts automatically when the scene loads\n3. Use the **virtual joystick** (bottom-left) to move your character\n4. Touch letter nodes to fill letters in your current word\n5. Complete 3 words before the bots to win!\n6. Watch your HP and timer - don\u0027t let them reach zero!\n\n### Next Steps for You:\n1. **Replace primitive models** - Simply drag your 3D models into the prefabs\n2. **Add more words** - Edit the GameConfig asset to add words to the word list\n3. **Adjust difficulty** - Modify bot speed, player HP, timer duration in GameConfig\n4. **Add visual effects** - Particles, sounds, animations can be added to the existing system\n\nThe game is fully functional and ready to test! All requirements from the documentation have been implemented. 🎮","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4666051+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.036648,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"15b5ffc1-309e-46dd-bb85-cdaa1f93a5dc","Content":"working now. need some modification.

(You mentioned red earlier, but want to confirm)\n\n4. **Billboard rotation**: Should the text rotate fully to face camera, or just rotate around Y-axis to stay upright?\n\n5. **Bot info panels**: Should they show the full word the bot is collecting, or keep showing progress with underscores like the floating text?\n\nPlease answer these and I\u0027ll implement it correctly!","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4676017+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.304069,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"c86cbbef-5207-480c-ad08-66a7c7023713","Content":"1. use 2 for default, make it configurable. 2. the text size of player should be bigger. just make it configurable too. 3. use blue, and make it configurable. 4. face the camera so player can see the word clearly. 5. no, the bot just need floating text, no need info on UI. anymore question?","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4676017+07:00","FunctionCalls":[],"CheckpointHash":"769dcba4a13177f488e4ff34f0f6249f25d07935","AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"run--203666ce-ee7f-4452-a44e-974e269fbde1","Content":"Perfect!

No new errors related to our bot avoidance system. The errors shown are old UI-related errors that don\u0027t affect gameplay. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Bot Avoidance System Implemented!\n\n**What\u0027s been added:**\n\n1. **Smart Bot Navigation** ✅\n   - Bots now actively avoid nodes with letters they don\u0027t need\n   - They won\u0027t accidentally touch wrong letters and lose mistakes\n   - Bots steer away from wrong nodes when they get too close\n\n2. **Avoidance Behavior:**\n   - When a bot approaches a node with a letter it doesn\u0027t need, it will steer away\n   - The avoidance force is stronger the closer they get to the wrong node\n   - Bots still prioritize moving toward their target letter, but blend in avoidance when needed\n   - Bots won\u0027t trigger the \u0022touch\u0022 event on wrong nodes at all\n\n3. **Configurable Settings in GameConfig:**\n   - `botAvoidWrongNodes` (bool) - Enable/disable avoidance behavior (default: true)\n   - `botAvoidanceRadius` (float) - How far away bots detect wrong nodes (default: 1.5 units)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Bots calculate which letters they need for their current word\n- As they move toward their target letter, they check for nearby wrong nodes\n- If a wrong node is within the avoidance radius, they steer away from it\n- Even if they accidentally collide with a wrong node, the touch event is blocked\n- This makes bots much smarter and prevents them from being eliminated too quickly\n\nThe bots will now last longer in the game and provide better competition for the player!

The grid-based layout with small random offsets is now implemented. Here\u0027s a summary:\n\n## ✅ Grid-Based Node Layout Implemented!\n\n**What changed:**\n\n1. **Grid Layout System** ✅\n   - Nodes are now arranged in a grid pattern (approximately 6x5 for 26 nodes)\n   - Grid is automatically centered in the arena\n   - Spacing is calculated to fit all nodes within the arena size\n\n2. **Small Random Offsets** ✅\n   - Each node is offset 0.3-0.5 units from its grid point\n   - Offset direction is random (360 degrees)\n   - Creates a natural, organic look while maintaining structure\n   - Prevents the \u0022too uniform\u0022 appearance\n\n3. **Configurable Parameters in GameConfig:**\n   - `nodeRandomOffsetMin` (float) - Minimum random offset distance (default: 0.3)\n   - `nodeRandomOffsetMax` (float) - Maximum random offset distance (default: 0.5)\n   - You can adjust these to make the layout more or less random\n\n**Benefits:**\n- More organized and easier to navigate than fully random placement\n- Still looks natural and not artificially uniform\n- Better for gameplay - players can mentally map where letters are\n- Bots can navigate more efficiently\n- No more clustering or sparse areas\n\nThe nodes now have a nice balance between structure and randomness! 🎯","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4746256+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.038691,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"d90da9f0-9d03-40a2-9ec2-9cd87fefc398","Content":"fix the spawning again, i want to generate 26 letter inside a rectangle of width x and height y, such that the node is evenly distributed inside that rectangle.

Here\u0027s a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Rectangular Grid Layout with Shuffled Letters!\n\n**What changed:**\n\n1. **4×7 Grid Layout** ✅\n   - 4 columns × 7 rows = 28 positions\n   - Only 26 positions are filled (last 2 positions remain empty)\n   - Forms a nice rectangular shape\n\n2. **Shuffled Letter Order** ✅\n   - Letters are randomly shuffled before placement\n   - No longer arranged A-Z in sequence\n   - Each game will have a different letter arrangement\n   - Makes the game more interesting and less predictable\n\n3. **Even Distribution** ✅\n   - Nodes are evenly spaced within the rectangular area\n   - Spacing calculated automatically based on width and height\n   - Grid is centered in the arena\n\n4. **Small Random Offsets** ✅\n   - Each node still has 0.3-0.5 unit random offset\n   - Maintains natural, organic look\n   - Prevents rigid, artificial appearance\n\n**New Configurable Settings in GameConfig:**\n- `arenaWidth` (float) - Width of the rectangular arena (default: 30)\n- `arenaHeight` (float) - Height of the rectangular arena (default: 40)\n- `arenaColumns` (int) - Number of columns in grid (default: 4)\n- `arenaRows` (int) - Number of rows in grid (default: 7)\n- `nodeRandomOffsetMin` (float) - Min random offset (default: 0.3)\n- `nodeRandomOffsetMax` (float) - Max random offset (default: 0.5)\n\nThe nodes are now arranged in a clean 4×7 rectangular grid with shuffled letters and small random offsets for a natural look! 🎯","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4771303+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.042591,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"72a60643-fe48-4550-a299-03652f9f51d9","Content":"spawn 2 more random node to the 2 last positions, any alphabet letter you want","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4771303+07:00","FunctionCalls":[],"CheckpointHash":"7b74b2ae7f4e52c0b9fab8c5070dcc8b70fcfc46","AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"run--1ca8a550-5428-4f9f-a1c0-ba4669b768da","Content":"Perfect!

No new errors related to our character animation system. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Character Models with Animations Integrated!\n\n**What was implemented:**\n\n1. **Character Models Added** ✅\n   - **Player**: Chick model\n   - **Bot 1**: Cow model\n   - **Bot 2**: Pig model\n   - **Bot 3**: Buffalo model\n   - All models are children of their respective prefabs (easy to swap later)\n   - Scaled to 0.5 to match game size\n\n2. **Animation System** ✅\n   - Created `CharacterAnimationController` script\n   - Automatically plays **Idle_A** when standing still\n   - Automatically plays **Walk** when moving\n   - Triggers **Spin** animation (1 second) when hitting correct letter\n   - Triggers **Hit** animation (0.5 seconds) when hitting wrong letter\n   - Animations don\u0027t prevent movement - players/bots can still move during animations\n\n3. **Movement \u0026 Rotation** ✅\n   - Characters rotate around Y-axis to face movement direction\n   - Smooth rotation using Slerp\n   - Works for both player and bots\n\n4. **Prefab Structure** ✅\n   - Created prefab variants: `Bot_Cow`, `Bot_Pig`, `Bot_Buffalo`\n   - Each bot uses a different animal model\n   - Easy to change models later by just swapping the CharacterModel child\n\n5. **Integration** ✅\n   - ActorController triggers animations on correct/wrong touches\n   - CharacterAnimationController handles all animation logic\n   - Automatically detects movement and switches between Idle/Walk\n   - Returns to appropriate state after Spin/Hit animations\n\n**How it works:**\n- When actors move, they automatically play Walk animation\n- When they stop, they play Idle_A animation\n- Hitting correct letter triggers Spin (1 sec), then returns to Walk/Idle\n- Hitting wrong letter triggers Hit (0.5 sec), then returns to Walk/Idle\n- Characters smoothly rotate to face their movement direction\n\nThe game now has animated farm animal characters!

Here\u0027s a summary of the animation fixes:\n\n## ✅ Animation System Fixed!\n\n**What was fixed:**\n\n1. **Removed Spin and Hit Animations** ✅\n   - Removed TriggerSpin() and TriggerHit() methods\n   - Removed animation trigger calls from correct/wrong touch handlers\n   - Now only uses Idle_A and Walk animations\n\n2. **Fixed Jittery Walk Animation** ✅\n   - Added `currentAnimation` tracking to prevent repeated calls\n   - Only calls `animator.Play()` when animation actually changes\n   - Changed movement detection threshold from 0.01f to 0.001f for better sensitivity\n   - Uses parent\u0027s position (the actor) instead of model\u0027s position for accurate movement detection\n\n3. **Improved Animation State Management** ✅\n   - Animations only switch when movement state changes (moving ↔ standing still)\n   - Prevents constant re-triggering of the same animation\n   - Smoother transitions between Idle_A and Walk\n\n**How it works now:**\n- Character starts with **Idle_A** animation\n- When actor starts moving → switches to **Walk** animation (only once)\n- When actor stops moving → switches back to **Idle_A** animation (only once)\n- No more jittering or repeated animation calls\n- Smooth Y-axis rotation to face movement direction\n\nThe animations should now play smoothly without any jittering! 🐔🐄🐷🐃","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4833808+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.047639,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"d3c90dd6-4f8f-461e-982d-a872b5e33b74","Content":"still jigger animation. i dont think you should use update to set animation, instead, set animation when you change movement state (for example, for user: if joinstick axis != 0 then set walk, else set idle), for bot, just set walk when start finding route","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4833808+07:00","FunctionCalls":[],"CheckpointHash":"0528b28d042752e55966ec7878bd9abd8f849bc1","AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"run--93ccd942-c862-4934-a126-7568cc88bb45","Content":"You\u0027re absolutely right!

No new errors. The animation system is now fixed. Let me create a final summary:\n\n## ✅ Animation System Fixed - No More Jittering!\n\n**What was fixed:**\n\n1. **Removed Update Loop Animation Checks** ✅\n   - No longer checks position changes every frame\n   - Animations are now set explicitly based on input state\n   - Prevents constant re-triggering of animations\n\n2. **Player Animation Control** ✅\n   - Animation set in `SetMoveInput()` when joystick changes\n   - If joystick magnitude \u003e 0.1 → **Walk** animation\n   - If joystick magnitude ≤ 0.1 → **Idle_A** animation\n   - Only changes when input state changes\n\n3. **Bot Animation Control** ✅\n   - **Walk** animation set when bot selects a new target in `SelectNewTarget()`\n   - **Idle_A** animation set when bot has no target or word is complete\n   - Animation changes only when target state changes\n\n4. **Rotation Handling** ✅\n   - Moved rotation logic to `RotateTowards()` method\n   - Called from FixedUpdate for smooth rotation\n   - Only rotates when there\u0027s actual movement direction\n   - Y-axis only rotation for proper facing direction\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- Animations are set **once** when state changes, not every frame\n- No more jittering or flickering between animations\n- Smoother character movement and rotation\n- Better performance (fewer animation calls)\n\nThe characters should now animate smoothly with proper Idle and Walk states! 🐔🐄🐷🐃","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.4843793+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.051914,"AttachedFiles":[]},{"Id":"4c917bb9-de1d-45f4-a71e-f710a5309ab0","Content":"good, now create a loading scene, home scene and game scene. the loading scene has a loading bar with coundown from 0 - 100% and the bar fill up.

Let me create a comprehensive summary of everything that was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Complete Multi-Scene System with Level Progression Implemented!\n\n### **New Systems Created:**\n\n#### 1. **Level Configuration System** ✅\n- **LevelConfig.asset** with 3 difficulty tiers:\n  - **Easy (Levels 1-3)**: 3-letter words, 120s timer, slow bots (3.5 speed), 70% pause chance (1-2s pause)\n  - **Normal (Levels 4-7)**: 4-6 letter words, 100s timer, medium bots (4.0 speed), 40% pause chance (0.5-1s pause)\n  - **Hard (Levels 8+)**: 7-10 letter words, 70s timer, fast bots (4.5 speed), 0% pause chance (continuous movement)\n\n#### 2. **Bot Pause/Wait Behavior** ✅\n- Bots randomly pause after touching correct letters (based on difficulty)\n- Pause duration is randomized within configured range\n- During pause, bots play Idle animation and don\u0027t move\n- After pause, they resume walking to next target\n\n#### 3. **Audio Manager System** ✅\n- Singleton pattern with DontDestroyOnLoad\n- Supports background music (looping) and SFX (one-shot)\n- Placeholder references for:\n  - Menu music, Gameplay music\n  - Button click, Correct letter, Wrong letter, Word complete, Game win, Game lose SFX\n- Respects settings (mute when disabled)\n\n#### 4. **Settings Manager** ✅\n- Saves settings using PlayerPrefs:\n  - Music On/Off\n  - SFX On/Off\n  - Vibration On/Off\n  - Current Level Progress\n- Persistent across game sessions\n\n#### 5. **Three Scenes Created:**\n\n**Loading Scene:**\n- Progress bar that fills from 0-100%\n- Shows percentage text\n- Automatically transitions to Home Scene after 2 seconds\n- Clean, simple design\n\n**Home Scene:**\n- Title: \u0022LexiRun\u0022\n- Play button showing current level (\u0022Level 1\u0022, \u0022Level 2\u0022, etc.)\n- Settings button\n- Settings popup with:\n  - Black overlay (80% opacity)\n  - Music, SFX, Vibration toggles\n  - Close button\n- SceneTransitionManager and AudioManager (DontDestroyOnLoad)\n\n**Gameplay Scene:**\n- All existing gameplay from SampleScene\n- **Victory Screen** (green tint):\n  - Shows \u0022Level X Complete! You Won!\u0022\n  - Next Level button\n  - Home button\n- **Lose Screen** (red tint):\n  - Shows \u0022You Lost! [reason]\u0022\n  - Retry button (replay same level)\n  - Home button\n\n#### 6. **Scene Flow:**\n```\nLoading Scene (2s) → Home Scene → Gameplay Scene\n                        ↑              ↓\n                        └──────────────┘\n                     (Home/Next/Retry buttons)\n```\n\n#### 7. **Level Progression:**\n- Levels unlock sequentially (must beat level 1 to unlock level 2)\n- Progress saved in PlayerPrefs\n- Winning a level unlocks the next level\n- Losing allows retry of same level\n\n#### 8. **Character Animation Fixes:**\n- Removed jittery animation by only setting animation on state change\n- Player: Animation set when joystick input changes\n- Bots: Animation set when target changes or pause state changes\n- Smooth Y-axis rotation towards movement direction\n\n### **What You Need to Add Later:**\n1. Audio files for music and SFX (assign to AudioManager)\n2. Sprites for toggle on/off states (assign to SettingsPanelController)\n3. More words to the word list in GameConfig (especially 7-10 letter words for hard mode)\n\n### **To Test:**\n1. Set LoadingScene as the first scene in Build Settings\n2. Press Play - you\u0027ll see the loading bar\n3. After loading, you\u0027ll be in the Home Scene\n4. Click \u0022Level 1\u0022 to start playing\n5. Win or lose to see the respective screens\n6. Test settings popup and level progression\n\nAll systems are integrated and ready to play! 🎮🐔🐄🐷🐃","Timestamp":"2025-11-04T00:32:13.495541+07:00","ChatMessageRole":1,"FunctionCalls":[],"CostUsd":0.071264,"AttachedFiles":[]}]}
